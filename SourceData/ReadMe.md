# Source data and statistics

## Description of files

Each Excel file contains the source data and associated statistical analysis results for the indicated figure. For figures with multiple panels, the data and statistics for individual panels are separated on individual spreadsheet tabs.

**Figs. 3 & S4**

Functional overrepresentation analysis was conducted using a Fisher’s exact test with histogram-based correction for multiple testing using custom R scripts (see [here](OverRepresentation/) for details).

**Figs. 4, S5, & S6**

For osmotolerance (area under the curve [AUC]) data, all statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.4.1. Each pair of light- and dark-exposed samples originated from a single culture. Datasets were assessed for normality using D’Agostino-Pearson’s, Anderson-Darling’s, Shapiro-Wilk’s, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov’s tests, and via visual assessment of QQ plots. Normality tests were conducted both before and after removal of outliers, which were identified using the robust regression and outlier removal (ROUT) method with a maximum desired FDR of Q = 1%; paired samples of identified outliers were also removed. Differences in osmotolerance between groups were evaluated by one-way or two-way repeated-measure ANOVA, where the repeated-measure is based on matched samples of a single original culture used for multiple treatments, or two-tailed paired-sample Student t-tests followed by appropriate post-hoc multiple comparisons tests as outlined in each file. Analyses were conducted on full datasets as well as outlier-cleared datasets when applicable.
